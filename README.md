Explore my two unforgettable weeks in Leipzig through this immersive 3D website created with Next.js and Typescript. I've combined the power of react-three-fiber and drei libraries to bring you a unique visual experience, allowing you to relive the moments and places that made my time in Germany truly special.

Next.js and Typescript: The website is built on Next.js, providing a seamless and efficient user experience and leverages the power of Next.js for server-side rendering. Typescript making the project not only visually appealing but also technically sound.

Thoughtful Layout Design: Thanks to the koestlich and apfel-kruemel libraries, the layout, including navigation, carousel, and footer, is not just functional but also aesthetically pleasing. Experience a website that's as delightful to navigate as the memories it holds.

React-three-fiber and drei Libraries: The 3D content is powered by react-three-fiber and drei, providing a smooth and performant rendering of the immersive scenes. These libraries enable the seamless integration of 3D elements into the web environment.

Thank you for visiting, and I hope you enjoy the journey as much as I did!
